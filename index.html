    <h2>About Italian Café</h2>
    <p>
        Established in 1960, Italian Café has been a warm destination for coffee lovers, food
        enthusiasts, and anyone who enjoys the comforting flavours of authentic Italian cuisine.
        What began as a small family espresso bar has grown into a beloved café known for its
        handcrafted dishes, rich brews, and cozy ambience inspired by the charming streets of Italy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our café takes pride in serving fresh ingredients, stone-baked pizzas, creamy cappuccinos,
        pastries, and traditional Italian delicacies. Every recipe carries the heritage of Italy and
        the passion of our founders who believed in honesty, flavour, and heartfelt hospitality.
    </p>

    <p>
        With rustic décor, relaxing wooden seating, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee,
        Italian Café creates the perfect environment for work, conversations, and peaceful breaks.
        Step inside and experience the heart of Italy right in your neighbourhood.
